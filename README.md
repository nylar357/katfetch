moon.sh - Tiny Colored Fetch Scriptmoon.sh is a simple and colorful bash script designed to display essential system information in a visually appealing format directly in your terminal. It's lightweight and uses standard command-line tools to gather information about your system.FeaturesDisplays Window Manager nameShows Kernel versionIndicates current ShellFetches External IP AddressShows Internal IP AddressDisplays Wi-Fi Network NameUses ANSI escape codes for colorDesigned to work with Typicons Font for icons (requires installation)DependenciesThis script relies on several standard Linux command-line utilities. Ensure you have the following installed:iwgetid: Part of the wireless-tools package. Used to determine the SSID of the wireless network the system is connected to.xprop: A utility for displaying window properties in the X Window System. In this script, it's used to identify and retrieve the name of the current Window Manager.curl: A tool to transfer data from or to a server. Used here to fetch the external IP address from ipinfo.io.uname: Prints system information. Used to get the kernel release version.basename: Strips directory and suffix from filenames. Used to get just the name of the shell from the full path provided by the $SHELL environment variable.ip: A utility to show or manipulate routing, network devices, policies, and tunnels. Used as an alternative method to find the internal IP address of an active network interface.Additionally, the script uses ANSI escape codes for coloring the output. For the icons to display correctly, you will need a font that supports the Typicons glyphs.How to UseSave the script as moon.sh (or any name you prefer).Make it executable: chmod +x moon.shRun it from your terminal: ./moon.shCustomization: Adding More InformationYou can easily modify this script to display other system details by adding commands to fetch the desired information and then including the output in the final cat <<EOF section.Here's how you could add information about your CPU or GPU:Identify the command: Find a command that provides the information you want.CPU Model:lshw -class processor: Provides detailed information about the CPU. You'd likely need to parse the output to get just the model name.cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | head -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f2 | sed 's/^ *//': A common way to get the CPU model from /proc/cpuinfo.GPU Model:lshw -class display: Provides information about graphics cards.nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name --format=csv,noheader: If you have an NVIDIA GPU and the nvidia-toolkit installed, this command directly outputs the GPU name.Add the command to the script: Add a line in the "Items" section to execute the command and store its output in a variable. For example, to get the CPU model:# CPU Model
cpu=$(echo "💻 ") # Add an icon (optional)
cpu_model="$(cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep 'model name' | head -n 1 | cut -d ':' -f2 | sed 's/^ *//')"
Or for an NVIDIA GPU:# GPU Model (NVIDIA)
gpu=$(echo "🎮 ") # Add an icon (optional)
gpu_model="$(nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name --format=csv,noheader)"
Include the new variable in the output: Add a line in the cat <<EOF section to display the variable's content.# ... (existing lines)
    $f2$sh  $t$shell
    $f5$ip $t$ipchk
    $f3$w $t$wifiname
	$f6$cpu $t$cpu_model # Add this line for CPU
	$f4$gpu $t$gpu_model # Add this line for GPU (adjust color code as needed)

# ... (rest of the output)
Remember to choose appropriate icons (if desired) and color codes ($f0 through $f7) for the new lines. You may need to install additional packages like lshw or nvidia-toolkit if you don't have them already.Feel free to experiment with other commands to display information like memory usage, disk space, uptime, etc.!
